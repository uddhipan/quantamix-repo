Deploying an Upgrade
When a Heroku application needs to be upgraded the same process needs to be repeated. After all the changes have been committed to the Git repository, the following commands perform an upgrade:

$ heroku maintenance:on
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku run flask deploy
$ heroku restart
$ heroku maintenance:off
